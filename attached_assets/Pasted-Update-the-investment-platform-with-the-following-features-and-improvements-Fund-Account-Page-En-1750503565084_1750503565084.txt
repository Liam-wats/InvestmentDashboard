Update the investment platform with the following features and improvements:
ðŸ’° Fund Account Page Enhancements

    Display real-time cryptocurrency prices (from CoinMarketCap or similar API) directly on the Fund Account page.

        Prices should update dynamically at regular intervals (e.g., every 60 seconds).

ðŸ§­ UI/UX Adjustments

    Add a "Fund Account" button to the top-right corner of the navigation bar for easy access.

        Style the button consistently with the platform's design (e.g., accent color, hover effects).

ðŸ”„ Wallet Address Configuration

    Replace the current funding addresses with the following wallet addresses for each coin:

        BTC: bc1q0uanf2f9px7q5r7maka05mwanutj8gvpqym62g

        ETH: 0xCd3B1Afe359d96eD77E3f44B7A55Dc12040858D0

        BNB: 0xCd3B1Afe359d96eD77E3f44B7A55Dc12040858D0

        USDT (ERC-20): 0xCd3B1Afe359d96eD77E3f44B7A55Dc12040858D0

    Display these wallet addresses clearly with copy-to-clipboard functionality and a note for users to send the exact amount.

ðŸ”— Blockchain Listener Integration

    Once a user sends payment to one of the wallet addresses:

        Use on-chain transaction listeners (e.g., via Web3.js, Ethers.js, or a webhook service like Moralis or Alchemy) to detect incoming transactions.

        Automatically verify the transaction (correct amount, confirmations).

        Upon successful confirmation:

            Update the user's total invested amount in the database.

            Reflect the updated value in the userâ€™s dashboard in real-time or after refresh.

    This entire process should be fully automated and secure, without manual admin intervention.

âœ… Testing & Validation

    Fully test the integration across:

        Blockchain listeners

        Backend investment update logic

        Real-time price display

        Wallet address display

    Confirm that the total invested amount updates accurately and reliably after each confirmed on-chain transaction.

Optional Enhancements

    Add email or in-app notifications to alert users when their funding is confirmed.

    Log transactions for audit and transparency
