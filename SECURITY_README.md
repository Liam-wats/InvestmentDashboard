# Blockchain Transaction Security Implementation

## Overview
This implementation ensures that user account balances are only updated after verified, confirmed on-chain transactions. The system prevents fake funding attempts and maintains strict security protocols.

## Security Measures

### 1. Transaction Amount Verification
- Converts all crypto amounts to USD using real-time price data
- Validates received amount is within 5% tolerance of expected amount
- Automatically rejects transactions with incorrect amounts
- Prevents over/under-funding attacks

### 2. Duplicate Transaction Prevention
- Checks transaction hash against existing database records
- Prevents multiple processing of the same blockchain transaction
- Maintains transaction integrity and prevents double-spending

### 3. User Eligibility Validation
- Requires KYC verification before allowing funding
- Validates user exists and account is in good standing
- Prevents unauthorized or fraudulent account funding

### 4. Blockchain Confirmation Requirements
- Requires minimum 3 block confirmations for security
- Only processes transactions with sufficient network consensus
- Waits for blockchain finality before crediting accounts

### 5. Real-time Monitoring with Moralis
- Uses authentic Moralis Web3 API for blockchain data
- Monitors specific wallet addresses for incoming transactions
- Validates all transaction data against actual blockchain state

## Webhook Configuration

### Required Moralis Streams Setup:
```
Webhook URL: https://your-domain.repl.co/api/webhook/moralis
Chain: Ethereum Mainnet (0x1)
Addresses: Listed wallet addresses
Transaction Types: Native Transactions + Contract Interactions
Confirmations: Minimum 3 blocks
Tag: investwise-funding
```

## API Endpoints

### Webhook Endpoint
- `POST /api/webhook/moralis` - Receives real-time transaction notifications
- Validates transaction authenticity and amount
- Updates user balances only after verification

### Status Endpoints
- `GET /api/blockchain/status` - Current monitoring status
- `GET /api/blockchain/transactions/:address` - Transaction history
- `POST /api/admin/security-test` - Security validation tests

## Security Flow

1. **User Initiates Funding**: Creates pending transaction record
2. **Real Transaction Required**: User must send actual crypto to wallet
3. **Moralis Detection**: Webhook receives transaction notification
4. **Multi-layer Validation**: Amount, duplicates, user eligibility checked
5. **Confirmation Wait**: Waits for 3+ block confirmations
6. **Balance Update**: Only then credits user account

## Fraud Prevention

### What's Blocked:
- Fake or simulated transactions
- Incorrect transaction amounts
- Duplicate transaction processing
- Unverified user funding attempts
- Insufficient blockchain confirmations

### What's Required:
- Real on-chain transaction to monitored wallet
- Correct cryptocurrency and amount
- Verified user account (KYC)
- Minimum 3 block confirmations
- Valid transaction hash and blockchain data

## Testing

Run security tests with:
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" -X POST /api/admin/security-test
```

This validates all security measures are functioning correctly.
